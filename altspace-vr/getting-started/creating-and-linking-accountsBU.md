## Account Registration FAQ

**Which name will other users see?**

Your "Display Name" is what other users will see above your avatar. Your "Username" will be displayed in the friends tab of the menu for people who have added you as a friend. Both your Display Name and Username will be visible on your avatar's nametag.

**Does my Display Name have to be unique?**
 
No, your user name can share the same Display Name as others. If you want your Display Name to be written as "Dave" or "Maria", you can! Your Display Name can also include spaces where a Username typically can't.

**I can't remember my password, how can I reset it?**

- If you're using a Microsoft account, you can follow the Microsoft password reset flow after starting the login process with the "Sign in with Microsoft" button. 
- If you're using a classic AltspaceVR account, you can use the "Forgot your password" link to reset your password, or You can reset your password [here](https://account.altvr.com/users/password/new).

**How can I change my Username or Display Name?**

To change your **Username or Display Name**, sign into altvr.com, select your profile icon on the top right, User Profile, Edit, and update your Username or Display Name. 

*Note: You will only be able to change your username once. Any time after that, you will have to submit a support ticket.*

If you want to change the Username associated with your account, [send us a ticket](https://help.altvr.com/hc/requests/new). Make sure to include the email associated with your account, your current name, and the username you'd like to use in the future.

**My menu is blank and I can't sign up, what can I do?**

If your "You" menu isn't displaying, restarting the AltspaceVR client should fix the issue so that you can sign in. Make sure that both your VR headset and your 2D monitor are plugged into the same GPU. Contact our [Help Desk](https://help.altvr.com/hc/requests/new) if the issue persists.

## Microsoft Account Integration FAQ

**Does this change my AltspaceVR Username or how my details appear in my name tag?**

Linking your AltspaceVR account with your Microsoft Account won't change your publically displayed username or first name. It will only change your account login credentials (which is private to you.) You'll still have full control over how your name, username, and profile picture appear to others in AltspaceVR.

**Can I still switch accounts? This option is no longer under Settings.**

Yes, we've redecorated a bit. You can now manage your account & switch accounts under **Main Menu > Me > Account**

**Do I already have a Microsoft Account?**

It's possible you already have a Microsoft Account. Do you play Minecraft, game on an Xbox, subscribe to Office 365, or otherwise use any other Microsoft products or services regularly? If so, you probably already have a Microsoft login! You can check to see if your email is already tied to an existing MSA [here](https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=13&ct=1610764342&rver=7.0.6738.0&wp=MBI_SSL&wreply=https:%2F%2Faccount.microsoft.com%2Fauth%2Fcomplete-signin%3Fru%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Faccount.microsoft.com%252F%253Frefp%253Dsignedout-index&lc=1033&id=292666&lw=1&fl=easi2).

**Does this mean that I need to create a new email address with Outlook?**

No. You can set up a Microsoft Account with a current email address even if it's not hosted with Microsoft. (Ex: G-Mail, Yahoo, and so on). If you sign in with Microsoft credentials that shares the same email as your classic AltspaceVR account, you'll be prompted to link your account after signing in. Follow the prompts to sign into your classic account, and your Altspace and Microsoft accounts will be linked for you.

**Does it cost money?**

Nope! Creating a Microsoft Account is free. Using AltspaceVR is also free. Just remember, your Microsoft Account is linked to other products and services, so you can use it to make purchases of things outside of AltspaceVR, like subscriptions (ex: Office 365) or specialty goods (ex: Minecraft Marketplace), for example.

**What if I'm having issues linking my accounts?**

If you're stuck, you can always contact us at our [Help Desk](https://help.altvr.com/hc/requests/new).

**What if I have multiple AltspaceVR accounts?**

Only one AltspsaceVR account can be linked to a Microsoft Account. You'll need a separate Microsoft Account for each of the AltspaceVR accounts you wish to connect.

**What if I forget my login details?**

**Do I have to connect to my Microsoft Account?**

Don't worry, you have some time to make the update. We'll be rolling our Microsoft Account integration in phases. However, over time, some of the major new features we're working on will only be available to individuals who have linked their AltspaceVR account to their Microsoft Account. The reason for this is that these features (like ticketed events, for example) require strong and robust security measures. Read more on our [blog](https://altvr.com/microsoft-account-integration).

**What about my privacy and data?**

There's no change to our [Terms of Service](../community/terms-of-service.md) or our [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).
